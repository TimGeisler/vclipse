VClipse is an Eclipse-based integrated development environment (IDE) for product modeling for the [SAP Variant Configurator (VC)](http://help.sap.com/printdocu/core/Print46c/en/Data/pdf/LOVC/LOVC.pdf). VClipse supports the specification of objects and dependencies in a textual domain specific language calld VCML. This enables the use of standard text comparison tools and version control systems in the model development process.

VClipse offers two interfaces SAP systems. The VC objects and dependencies can be transferred to or retrieved from a SAP system using SAP's remote function calls ([RFC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Function_Call)). Furthermore, the VC objects and dependencies can be transferred using product data replication (PDR) via [IDocs](http://help.sap.com/saphelp_nw70/helpdata/en/0b/2a6095507d11d18ee90000e8366fc2/frameset.htm).

VClipse is implemented using the [Xtext](http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/) framework and the [Java Pretty Printer Library](http://jpplib.sourceforge.net/).
